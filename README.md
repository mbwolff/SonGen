# SonGenApp
## A sonnet generator

This code will be presented at the [2019 Electronic Literature Organization's conference in Cork, Ireland](http://elo2019.ucc.ie).

There are two Python modules in this repository, one for generating sonnets in French and the other in English. There really should be one master module that can be parameterized for specific languages and corpora, but I leave that project for another day. Both modules are very similar and differ only in the way they handle source data and scansion rules (alexandrines or pentameters, for instance).
